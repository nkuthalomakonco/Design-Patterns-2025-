//The Memento Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to capture and restore the internal state 
//    of an object without exposing its implementation details.

//Key points:

//Keeps the state of an object externally.

//Allows undo/rollback functionality.

//Consists of Originator, Memento, and Caretaker.
